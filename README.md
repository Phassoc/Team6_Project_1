# Team6_Project_1

# Data Sources
covid19tracking
  State and National for history of testing, hospitalization, and death
Census.gov
  State and County populations (2018 estimate)
Johns Hopkins githup repo
  County testing, hospitalization, and death

# Methodology
Looking at MN data, and want to compare testing, hospitalization, and death
  MN vs national
  MN vs similar population size State
  MN City/County vs similar population size City/County in a different State 

Comparisons will constitute 

We're intentionally choosing Hennepin and Ramsey 
 
  
# Steps
Create dataframes
  Johns Hopkins just current for counties we care about (MN Hennepin & Ramsey)
  Consolidate State and County Population from Census.gov
  Summary at higher levels - State(s), National, of Pop, testing, hospitalization, and death 

Determine similar State and City/County/Metro Area to compare against (Ian Mac)
  Just similar pop county, look at County area for density

Determine chart types and visualization methods

Research source for county testing and hospitalization data

If none, extrapolation down to county from State totals based on confirmed cases and deaths?

Do we want history for County data? Would need to compile from Johns Hopkins files

Pretty up this readme (Rob)

Play with charting (Rob)

Bring in other DataFrames from Census and JHU and summary from covid tracking for MN and National (Phil)

Clone JHU repo into ours? (Phil)
